# Contact-less-Doorbell
This project of Contact less Doorbell is an IoT based Project which is deployed on the Entry/exit of a house/ office/ company. Whenever there is a person or any activity detected at the gate the buzzer rings inside. Along with the bell there is a gate lock attached to it so that if an authorized person is there the gate can be unlocked by a switch.
In this project we have also installed a relay which is connected with a  lock so that the gate unlocks automatically when there is someone authorized at the door.
